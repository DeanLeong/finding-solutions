# Finding solutions

## Objectives
* Determine the steps needed to be able to find information efficiently 
* <b>Google Tips and Tricks</b> to find new topics, code samples, scan search results, error handling and more


## STEP 1: Check lessons and previous assignments

Lessons are designed to expose you to new topics quickly, followed with a practice coding assignment to build muscle memory.  Mostly likely the assignment you are working on has some answers in the lesson repository. The lesson goes into depth on the subject and has additional resources links to continue learning on the subject.

Lessons build on top of concepts from the previous lesson, you might have to dig into a lesson from a previous day or unit.

<b>Check the Weekly Recap for the links of all of the lessons, practices and homework assignments.</b>

### STEP 2: Check with your neighbor

During lessons: you want to be respectful of your neighbor and their process of learning. So if it's a quick "I just lost a step and can you tell me what I missed", go for it. Otherwise, it's better to go to Step 3

During practice assignments: unless it is a pair programming/group assignment it's better to go to Step 4

After class: study together, ask questions, teach each other and que up with your TA!


### STEP 3: Post your questions in the parking lot

The parking lot slack channel is used to ask questions and start conversations about topics that are still unclear. Maybe we covered a concept but already moved on or maybe it's a question that is out of the scope of the lecture, the parking lot is the best place to discuss these topics. 

*It is encouraged that if you feel like you know the answer to a question posted by your fellow classmates, contribute to the conversation.*

Ask and answer questions without derailing the lecture, but don't forget to focus on the new material beign covered.


### STEP 4: Google is your best friend

You can search and find literally anthing on google. The amount of information can be an overload. The key is learning how to narrow your search by targeting keywords and quickly finding the resource that will help YOU to find your answer. 

Do a google search for ```how to search on google``` and you will find this resource [How to search on Google](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/134479?hl=en)

> Tip 1: Start with the basics
> No matter what you're looking for, start with a simple search like `where's the closest airport?`. You can always add a few descriptive words if necessary.
If you're looking for a place or product in a specific location, add the location. For example, `bakery seattle`. 

#### Programming Tips: 
* Add `js` - **no need to type out javascript**
* Add `css`,`html`,`sql`,`ruby` - be specific to the language
* Add `react`,`express`,`rails` - be specific to the framework

* Add `tutorial` - if you want to learn something
* Check out video tab to dive deeper into the material

> Tip 3: Choose words carefully
> When you're deciding what words to put in the search box, try to choose words that are likely to appear on the site you're looking for. For example, instead of saying `my head hurts`, say `headache`, because that’s the word a medical site would use.

#### Programming Tips: 
* `making things in javascript values` —> `js data types`
* `how do I create a for loop in javascript` —> `js for loops`


> Tip 4: Don’t worry about the little things
> * Spelling. Google's spell checker automatically uses the most common spelling of a given word, whether or not you spell it correctly. 
* Capitalization. A search for `New York Times` is the same as a search for `new york times`.




> Expert Search tips
* [Search operators](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433)

> Refine web searches

> Exclude words from your search
> Put - in front of a word you want to leave out. For example, jaguar speed -car

>Search for an exact match
> Put a word or phrase inside quotes. For example, "tallest building". 

### Let's make some google searches
